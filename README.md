# HackNU-App
The iOS application made special for HackNU 2023, which allows couriers to take orders (delivering documents) from the clients of "Government for citizens" in Kazakhstan

The service our team developed during the hackathon is a document delivery service for clients of Centralized Service Centers (CSCs) (ЦОН) in Kazakhstan. The service consists of a website and a mobile application.

The client of (ЦОН) receives a SMS which says that their document is ready to be delivered to him snd provides a link to our web-site where he can fill in his delivery details, choose his preferred delivery service, and make a payment.

Receiving the SMS       |   Filling all the necessary information       |   Making a Payment
